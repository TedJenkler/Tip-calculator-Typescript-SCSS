## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
- **Extra Test using Jest:** Ensure app works using Jest

## My Process

### Built With

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A frontend build tool for fast development with a modern workflow.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - For advanced styling and creating flexible, maintainable stylesheets.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs) - For adding type safety and enhancing the development experience with static types.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs) - A testing framework for ensuring the correctness of JavaScript and TypeScript code with features like test runners, assertions, and mocking.

### What I Learned

During this project, I gained more experience in the following areas:

- **SCSS:** Enhanced understanding of SCSS features like mixins, maps, variables, and responsive design.
- **TypeScript:** Improved skills in TypeScript, including type definitions, interfaces, and generics for better type safety and code quality.
- **Custom Hooks:** Developed and utilized custom React hooks for better code organization and reusability.
- **Animations:** Gained experience in creating smooth and interactive animations to enhance the user interface and overall user experience.
- **Jest:** Acquired proficiency in using Jest for testing JavaScript and TypeScript applications

### Continued Development

- Plan to implement the tip calculation using Three.js for a fun and interactive 3D experience.
